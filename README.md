[Open Color Tool](https://dbstraight.github.io/color-tool/)

[See an example of it in use](https://dbstraight.github.io/color-tool/#eJyLjlZSKUpNUdJRUknKKU0F0soGaQZKsTrRSumpJRoqjoY6ClYZxTm6GZpAObCQE6aQM5IQSCuQCVRnpKNgoGcKJkAqi8HmGcNU6iikowpoKmgrmCBUOqGrdMJQCbIK1dRikG1GWAxBl3DGkIiNBQAebEPv)

## What is this?

It's a tool for building color palettes by describing relationships
between colors. It's something like a spreadsheet for color
palettes.

## Sounds cool, is there any documentation?

No. This is a side project built in my very minimal free time. I may
add documentation at some point, but there is none now.

## Is it supported? Will you make a change / add something for me?

No. See above. But you are welcome to fork and make changes as long as
you follow the license.

## If I use it, will you break my work in future releases?

Probably. Nothing in this repo should be considered stable. It is,
right now, a toy project for my own amusement. I hope it amuses you as
well, but you shouldn't rely on it in any way.

## Isn't Color Tool a pretty lame name?

Yes. I will almost certainly change it at some point, renaming the
repository and breaking any links to the github-pages deployment. See
above about not relying on this project in any way.

## What is the license?

APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0 (Apache-2.0)
